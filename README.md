## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
For this project, I decided to test out and see how easy it would be to use MapBox API for maps integration and whatnot. This repository contains non-sensitive code from one of my pet projects titled "best-coffeeshops-orlando-metro". 

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Feel free to use (or tweak it) for your own use. You will only need to copy and paste it onto a newly created Flutter project (don't forget to fork it!). Pro-tip: edit the <b>pubsepc.yaml</b> file on your project so that is affects the images and/or additional files you might want to implement on your own project.
